# How to Add Outer Glow Effects in GIMP

The "Outer Glow" effect is a gradient applied to the outer edges of a selection that makes it appear to glow. GIMP doesn't have a dedicated outer glow feature like Photoshop, but it does offer a drop shadow effect. With a bit of tweaking, you can use this feature to create an outer glow.

1. Click "Filters," then "Light and Shadow." Click "Drop Shadow."
2. Type "0" into the "Y" axis field and "0" into the "X" axis field.
3. Click the the color palette on the open window and select the color you want for the outer glow.
4. Slide the opacity slider. A high opacity percentage means the glow will be more solid, while a low percentage means the glow will be more transparent.
5. Click "OK." A glow will appear around the edges of your layer or selected item.
