# How to reset Cync by GE smart lights

### Timed Sequence

**To reset your bulbs, there is a timed   that is repeated until the bulbs blink.**

✎ **NOTE:** Make sure to turn the power on and off at the wall switch and not within the app.

Steps for timed sequence:

1. Start with light off for at least 5 seconds.
2. Turn on for 8 seconds.
3. Turn off for 2 seconds.
4. Repeat this process 5 more times, or until the light bulb flashes. The light will flash 3 times if it has been successfully reset.

✧ You can now begin the reconnection process within the app.
