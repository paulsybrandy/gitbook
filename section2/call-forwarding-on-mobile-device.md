# Call Forwarding on mobile device

## How do I use call forwarding?

With call forwarding, you can direct your mobile calls to another phone number, like your home or office number. The feature is included with the Xfinity Mobile plan, whether you have Unlimited or By the Gig data, at no additional cost. So let’s get it set up!

#### <mark style="color:orange;">Turn on call forwarding</mark> <a href="#mcetoc_1ekh364b411" id="mcetoc_1ekh364b411"></a>

There are two styles of call forwarding. You can set it up so that all calls automatically forward to another number, without your mobile device ringing first, or you can have call forwarding ring on your mobile device first and only go to another number if you don’t answer the call on your mobile device. Here are the steps:

1. <mark style="color:orange;">On your Xfinity Mobile device, dial \*72 if you want all calls to automatically forward.</mark> Dial \*71 if you only want unanswered calls to forward.
2. After you have dialed one of the above options, next dial the 10-digit phone number (including area code) where you want your calls to be forwarded. For example, you'd dial \*72-111-222-3333.
3. Press the **Call** button and wait for a confirmation tone and message.
4. End the call.

#### Things to remember with call forwarding <a href="#mcetoc_1ekh364b412" id="mcetoc_1ekh364b412"></a>

* You must turn on call forwarding from your Xfinity Mobile device. You cannot turn it on from another phone or a computer.
* Calls cannot be forwarded to international numbers, only domestic 10-digit numbers, including toll-free numbers.
* If call forwarding is enabled, unanswered calls will not be directed to your mobile device's voicemail.
* Call forwarding does not affect text messages. They will still come through as normal on your mobile device.
