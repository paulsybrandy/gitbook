# Exportify Documentation

### Usage



1. Fire up [the app](https://exportify.app/)
2. Click 'Get Started'
3. Grant Exportify read-only access to your playlists
4. Click the 'Export' button to export a playlist

Click 'Export All' to save a zip file containing a CSV file for each playlist in your account. This may take a while when many playlists exist and/or they are large.

#### Re-importing Playlists



Once playlists are saved, it's also pretty straightforward to re-import them into Spotify. Open up the CSV file in Excel, for example, select and copy the `spotify:track:xxx` URIs, then simply create a playlist in Spotify and paste them in. This has only been tested with the desktop app.

#### Export Format



Track data is exported in [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) encoded [CSV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated\_values) format with the following fields from the [Spotify track object](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/get-several-tracks):

* Track URI
* Track Name
* Artist URI(s)
* Artist Name(s)
* Album URI
* Album Name
* Album Artist URI(s)
* Album Artist Name(s)
* Album Release Date
* Album Image URL (typically 640x640px jpeg)
* Disc Number
* Track Number
* Track Duration (ms)
* Track Preview URL (mp3)
* Explicit?
* Popularity
* ISRC ([International Standard Recording Code](https://isrc.ifpi.org/en/))
* Added By
* Added At

By clicking on the cog, additional data can be exported.

By selecting "Include artists data", the following fields will be added from the [Spotify artist object](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/get-multiple-artists):

* Artist Genres

And by selecting "Include audio features data", the following fields will be added from the [Spotify audio features object](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/get-several-audio-features):

* Danceability
* Energy
* Key
* Loudness
* Mode
* Speechiness
* Acousticness
* Instrumentalness
* Liveness
* Valence
* Tempo
* Time Signature

Additionally, by selecting "Include album data", the following fields will be added from the [Spotify album object (full)](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/get-an-album)

* Album Genres
* Label
* Copyrights

Note that the more data being exported, the longer the export will take.

#### Playlist Search



If you're searching for a specific playlist to export, you can use the search facility to find it quickly by name:

![100201109-eb0d7d00-2eff-11eb-993e-7ed955e2361c.gif](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17737/100201109-eb0d7d00-2eff-11eb-993e-7ed955e2361c.gif)

* Searching is _case-insensitive_.
* Search results can be exported as a zip file by clicking "Export Results"

Warning

Please be aware that if you have a very large number of playlists, there may be a small delay before the first search results appear since the Spotify API itself doesn't allow for searching directly, so all playlists must be retrieved first.

**Advanced Search Syntax**



Certain search queries have special meaning:

| Search query          | Meaning                                |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `public:true`         | Only show public playlists             |
| `public:false`        | Only show private playlists            |
| `collaborative:true`  | Only show collaborative playlists      |
| `collaborative:false` | Don't show collaborative playlists     |
| `owner:me`            | Only show playlists I own              |
| `owner:[owner]`       | Only show playlists owned by `[owner]` |

### Development



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, first run `yarn install` to set up dependencies, then you can run:

**`yarn start`**

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

**`yarn test`**

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

**`yarn build`**

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

#### Stack



In addition to [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), the application is built using the following tools/libraries:

* [React](https://reactjs.org/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
* [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/) - styling and UI components
* [Font Awesome 6](https://fontawesome.com/) - vector icon set and toolkit
* [react-i18next](https://react.i18next.com/) - internationalization framework
* [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) - light-weight solution for testing React DOM nodes
* [MSW](https://mswjs.io/) - network-level request mocking (more of my own thoughts [here](https://watsonbox.github.io/posts/2020/11/30/discovering-msw.html))

#### History



* 2015: Exportify is [born](https://github.com/watsonbox/exportify/commit/b284822e12c3adea8fb83258fdb00ec4690701e1)
* 2020: [Major release](https://watsonbox.github.io/posts/2020/12/02/exportify-refresh.html) including search, artist and audio features, liked songs export, and a new rate limiting system
* 2024: [Major release](https://watsonbox.github.io/posts/2024/09/04/exportify-updates.html) including dark mode, internationalization, and search enhancements

### Notes



*   According to Spotify's [documentation](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/working-with-playlists/):

    > Folders are not returned through the Web API at the moment, nor can be created using it".

    Unfortunately that's just how it is.
* I've [gone to some lengths](https://github.com/watsonbox/exportify/pull/75) to try to eliminate errors resulting from excessively high usage of the Spotify API. Nonetheless, exporting data in bulk is a fairly request-intensive process, so please do try to use this tool responsibly. If you do require more throughput, please consider [creating your own Spotify application](https://github.com/watsonbox/exportify/issues/6#issuecomment-110793132) which you can use with Exportify directly.
* Disclaimer: It should be clear, but this project is not affiliated with Spotify in any way. It's just an app using their API like any other, with a cheeky name and logo ðŸ˜‡.
* In case you don't see the playlists you were expecting to see and realize you've accidentally deleted them, it's actually possible to [recover them](https://support.spotify.com/us/article/can-i-recover-a-deleted-playlist/).

### Running With Docker



To build and run Exportify with docker, run:

**`docker build . -t exportify`**

**`docker run -p 3000:3000 exportify`**

And then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) to view it in the browser.
